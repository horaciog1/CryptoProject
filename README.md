# Introduction to Cryptography Project

Implement the 3 modes we've covered in class, `CBC`, `OFB` and `CTR`, and compare their
performance for (encryption, decryption).

Project written in Python3 using the `PyCryptodome` Library to implement the encryption algorithms.

This project will be comparing the performances of AES, DES, 3DES and Blow-fish with the modes of encryption. We will also be using parallelization when possible.
